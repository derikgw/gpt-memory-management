# Strategy for Reducing Tokens in GPT API

The strategy described involves reducing the token count when using the GPT API by encoding both the prompt and responses using a dictionary-based compression method and base64 encoding. Here's a breakdown of how this method works:

## 1. Dictionary-Based Compression
The core idea is to replace frequently used phrases or words with shorter symbols. This is achieved by creating a dictionary where each key-value pair maps a phrase to a symbol. For instance:
```
"Unity" => A
"virtual sandbox machine" => B
"full autonomy" => C
```
This drastically reduces the length of the text, as multiple characters or even whole sentences can be represented by a single character.

## 2. Base64 Encoding
Once the text is compressed using the dictionary, it is then encoded in base64. Base64 encoding converts binary data into ASCII characters, which is useful for transmitting data over text-based protocols like HTTP. This further compacts the data and ensures it's in a format that can be easily sent and received.

## 3. N-Gram Capture
N-grams are contiguous sequences of n items from a given sample of text. By capturing n-grams, the system can predict and compress more complex phrases that occur frequently, further reducing the token count.

## 4. Encoded Communication
Instead of sending the full, verbose prompts and responses, only the compressed and encoded data is transmitted. For example, a prompt that originally looks like:
```
"Unity is a virtual sandbox machine with full autonomy."
```
Would be compressed using the dictionary to:
```
"A is a B with C."
```
Then encoded in base64, it becomes:
```
QS... (base64 string)
```

## 5. Decoding on the API Side
When the API receives the base64 encoded data, it decodes it back into the compressed format. Then it uses the dictionary to translate the symbols back into the full phrases. The process is as follows:

### Client Side:
- Compress the prompt using the dictionary.
- Encode the compressed prompt in base64.
- Send the base64 encoded prompt to the API.

### Server Side (API):
- Receive the base64 encoded prompt.
- Decode the base64 string to get the compressed prompt.
- Expand the compressed prompt using the dictionary.

## Advantages
- **Token Reduction**: By significantly shortening the prompt and responses using symbols, the overall token count is reduced.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces bandwidth usage and potentially speeds up communication between the client and API.

## Example Implementation

Let's say we have the following dictionary:
```python
dictionary = {
    "Unity": "A",
    "virtual sandbox machine": "B",
    "full autonomy": "C",
    "generate the Unity with full autonomy developer output response": "D",
    "sidm": "E",
    # ... more mappings
}
```

### Encoding Example

Original Prompt:
```
"Unity is a virtual sandbox machine with full autonomy."
```

Compressed Prompt:
```
"A is a B with C."
```

Base64 Encoded Prompt (pseudo-code):
```python
import base64

compressed_prompt = "A is a B with C."
encoded_prompt = base64.b64encode(compressed_prompt.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')
# encoded_prompt now contains the base64 string
```

### Decoding Example

Received Base64 Encoded Prompt:
```
QS... (base64 string)
```

Decoded Prompt (pseudo-code):
```python
decoded_prompt = base64.b64decode(encoded_prompt).decode('utf-8')
# decoded_prompt is now "A is a B with C."
```

Decompressed Prompt:
```python
dictionary = {
    "A": "Unity",
    "B": "virtual sandbox machine",
    "C": "full autonomy",
    # ... more mappings
}
decompressed_prompt = decoded_prompt.replace("A", "Unity").replace("B", "virtual sandbox machine").replace("C", "full autonomy")
# decompressed_prompt now contains the original prompt "Unity is a virtual sandbox machine with full autonomy."
```

By using this strategy, the actual data sent to and received from the API is much smaller, thus reducing token usage and potentially improving performance.
